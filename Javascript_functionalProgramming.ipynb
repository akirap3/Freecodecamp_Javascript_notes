    "- Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.\n",
    "- Functional programming follows a few core principles:\n",
    "    - Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation\n",
    "    - Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data\n",
    "    - Functions have minimal side effects in the program\n",
    "- The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts."

    "- `Array.prototype.reduce()`, or simply `reduce()`, is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `reduce` method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both `filter` and `map` can be derived as special applications of `reduce`. The `reduce` method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which `reduce` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to the callback function, `reduce` has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.\n",

Recall from prior challenges how to `filter` data and `map` over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, and return the average rating from `getRating` function. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations."
