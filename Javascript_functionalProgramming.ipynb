    "- Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.\n",
    "- Functional programming follows a few core principles:\n",
    "    - Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation\n",
    "    - Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data\n",
    "    - Functions have minimal side effects in the program\n",
    "- The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts."
